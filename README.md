# COVID19-UFM-PROJECT

## Purpose
My purpose while doing the project was to inform people of the dangers that can be present, even though our country has been able to contain the virus and have our current situation of infections be stable.

## Context
When the pandemic recently began, fear spread quickly between people and it seemed as though we would not have contact with anyone until the vaccine was created and delivered to everyone. Now, we can see people going to the malls, hanging out in restaurants/bars and the overall fear has reduced drastically. Our country had one of the longest lockdowns globally, citizens started getting desperate as their incomes were dependent if the economy would re-activate. Even now with the "new normal", people have been struggling to make a living and find jobs. To a certain extent, it seems justifiable that people want to get out and restore that human connection that they have with family and friends. In other cases, they might be looking for an opportunity to work whatever the cost, even if it means their probability of getting infected will get higher.

### Notes
Below you can find all the sources I used for the project. The first one is where I retreived the infections info, the second one had the methods used in order to create the circular graph, and lastly I included the youtube video tutorial (alongside the GitHub repo) where I based my code. I made some minor modifications and included the Guatemala data to adapt the model better for our project.
